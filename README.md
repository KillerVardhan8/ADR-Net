# Adverse Drug Reaction-Neural Networks(ADR-Net)

Case Study Implementation of the Research Paper [here](https://github.com/KillerVardhan8/ADR-Net/blob/75a018eaa65d0eeae52f7dbd95624af6dfd67b41/Research%20Paper%20(ANN%20and%20LSA%20for%20Adverse%20Drug%20Reaction%20Detection)%20.pdf) which deals about **Artificial Neural Networks** and **Latent Semantic Analysis** for **Adverse Drug Reaction Detection** related to **Neuro Fuzzy and Genetic Programming** subject.

## ADR Test
The "ADR Test" file uses Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to analyze user-reported Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). This file identifies hidden patterns and associations in the text, helping to better understand user experiences with various drugs.

## Accuracy
The "Accuracy" file compares the performance of the LSA model with other machine learning models using F-Scores. It evaluates which model is most accurate in predicting ADRs, ensuring the best approach for analyzing user-reported data.
