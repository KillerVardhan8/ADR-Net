# Adverse Drug Reaction-Neural Networks(ADR-Net)

Case Study Implementation of the Research Paper [here](Research Paper (ANN and LSA for Adverse Drug Reaction Detection) .pdf) which deals about **Artificial Neural Networks** and **Latent Semantic Analysis** for **Adverse Drug Reaction Detection** related to Neuro Fuzzy and Genetic Programming subject.

The File Accuracy compares the Accuracy of the model with other machine learning models based on F-Scores
