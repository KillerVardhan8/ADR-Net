# Adverse Drug Reaction-Neural Networks(ADR-Net)

Case Study Implementation of the Research Paper [here](https://github.com/KillerVardhan8/ADR-Net/blob/75a018eaa65d0eeae52f7dbd95624af6dfd67b41/Research%20Paper%20(ANN%20and%20LSA%20for%20Adverse%20Drug%20Reaction%20Detection)%20.pdf) which deals about **Artificial Neural Networks** and **Latent Semantic Analysis** for **Adverse Drug Reaction Detection** related to Neuro Fuzzy and Genetic Programming subject.

The File Accuracy compares the Accuracy of the model with other machine learning models based on F-Scores
